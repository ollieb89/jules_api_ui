Safe production deployment with testing, building, and verification steps.

description: Deploy application to production with safety checks

1. Verify we're on the main branch.
2. Pull latest changes to ensure we're up to date.
   // turbo
3. Run git pull origin main
4. Run all tests to ensure code quality.
   // turbo
5. Run npm test
6. Build the production bundle.
   // turbo
7. Run npm run build
8. Verify build completed successfully (check for build errors).
9. Ask user for final confirmation before deploying.
10. Deploy to production.
11. Run npm run deploy or platform-specific command
12. Verify deployment succeeded by checking the live URL.
13. Create a git tag for this release.
    // turbo
14. Run git tag -a v[version] -m "Production release [version]"
15. Push the tag to remote.
    // turbo
16. Run git push origin v[version]

Usage:

- Say "Deploy to production" or use /deploy_production
- Follow prompts for confirmation
- Monitor deployment progress

Safety Features:

- Tests run before deployment
- Build verification
- User confirmation required
- Git tagging for rollback
- Deployment verification

Best Practices:

- Always test before deploying
- Tag releases for tracking
- Verify deployment success
- Keep deployment logs
- Have rollback plan ready

Customization:

- Add database migration step
- Include environment variable checks
- Add Slack/Discord notifications
- Include rollback procedure
- Add performance monitoring
