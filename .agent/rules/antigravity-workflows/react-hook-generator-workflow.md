Scaffold custom React hooks with standard boilerplate code.

Workflow File: .agent/workflows/create_hook.md

description: Create a new custom React hook with standard boilerplate

1. Ask the user for the name of the hook (must start with "use", e.g., "useWindowSize").
2. Create a new file in src/hooks/[HookName].js.
3. Add the following boilerplate code to the file:javascript
   import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

   export const [HookName] = () => {
   const [data, setData] = useState(null);

   useEffect(() => {
   // Logic goes here
   console.log('[HookName] mounted');
   }, []);

   return { data };
   };

4. Verify that the hook is exported as a named export.

Usage:

- Say "Create a custom hook" or use /create_hook
- Provide hook name (must start with 'use')
- AI generates complete hook file

Benefits:

- Enforces naming conventions
- Standard hook structure
- Includes useState and useEffect setup
- Ready for custom logic

Customization:

- Add TypeScript support (.ts)
- Include additional hooks (useCallback, useMemo)
- Add JSDoc comments
- Include unit test file
