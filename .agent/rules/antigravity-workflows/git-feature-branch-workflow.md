Create a workflow to start new feature branches synchronized with main.

Workflow File: .agent/workflows/start_feature.md

description: Start a new feature branch synchronized with main

1. Ask the user for the name of the feature (e.g., "user-auth").
2. Switch to the main branch to ensure we start fresh.
   // turbo
3. Run git checkout main
4. Pull the latest changes from the remote repository.
   // turbo
5. Run git pull origin main
6. Create and switch to the new feature branch.
   // turbo
7. Run git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]

Usage:

- Say "Start a new feature" or use /start_feature
- AI will ask for feature name
- Commands run automatically with turbo

Benefits:

- Ensures clean start from main
- Prevents merge conflicts
- Standardizes branch naming
- Saves time on repetitive commands

Variations:

- Add linting check before branch creation
- Include initial commit with boilerplate
- Add branch protection checks
