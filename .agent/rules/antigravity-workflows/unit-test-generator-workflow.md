description: Generate a unit test file for an existing component or function

1. Ask the user for the relative path of the file they want to test.
2. Read the content of the target file to understand its logic.
3. Create a new test file in the same directory with .test.js extension.
4. Write comprehensive unit tests for the exported functions using standard Jest/React Testing Library syntax.
5. Verify that all imports in the test file are correct.

Usage:

- Say "Generate tests for [filename]" or use /generate_test
- Provide path to file to test
- AI reads file and creates comprehensive tests

Benefits:

- Saves time writing boilerplate tests
- Ensures test coverage
- Uses best practices (Jest/RTL)
- Tests all exported functions
- Correct import paths

Generated Test Structure:

- describe blocks for each function/component
- Multiple test cases per function
- Edge case testing
- Mock setup when needed
- Proper assertions

Customization:

- Add snapshot testing
- Include integration tests
- Add coverage thresholds
- Support different test frameworks
